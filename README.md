# What is Data Exploration?
Data exploration definition: Data exploration refers to the initial step in data analysis in which data analysts use data visualization and statistical techniques to describe dataset characterizations, such as size, quantity, and accuracy, in order to better understand the nature of the data.  Data exploration techniques include both manual analysis and automated data exploration software solutions that visually explore and identify relationships between different data variables, the structure of the dataset, the presence of outliers, and the distribution of data values in order to reveal patterns and points of interest, enabling data analysts to gain greater insight into the raw data.  Data is often gathered in large, unstructured volumes from various sources and data analysts must first understand and develop a comprehensive view of the data before extracting relevant data for further analysis, such as univariate, bivariate, multivariate, and principal components analysis.

# Why is Data Exploration Important?
Humans process visual data better than numerical data, therefore it is extremely challenging for data scientists and data analysts to assign meaning to thousands of rows and columns of data points and communicate that meaning without any visual components.

Data visualization in data exploration leverages familiar visual cues such as shapes, dimensions, colors, lines, points, and angles so that data analysts can effectively visualize and define the metadata, and then perform data cleansing. Performing the initial step of data exploration enables data analysts to better understand and visually identify anomalies and relationships that might otherwise go undetected.


# What is Exploratory Data Analysis?
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), similar to data exploration, is a statistical technique to analyze data sets for their broad characteristics. Visualization tools for exploratory data analysis such as OmniSciâ€™s Immerse platform enable interactivity with raw data sets, giving analysts increased visibility into the patterns and relationships within the data.

# Data Exploration in Machine Learning
A Machine Learning project is as good as the foundation of data on which it is built. In order to perform well, machine learning data exploration models must ingest large quantities of data, and model accuracy will suffer if that data is not thoroughly explored first. Data exploration steps to follow before building a machine learning model include: 

* Variable identification: define each variable and its role in the dataset 
* Univariate analysis: for continuous variables, build box plots or histograms for each variable independently; for categorical variables, build bar charts to show the frequencies
* Bi-variable analysis - determine the interaction between variables by building visualization tools
*  ~Continuous and Continuous: scatter plots
*  ~Categorical and Categorical: stacked column chart
*  ~Categorical and Continuous: boxplots combined with swarmplots
* Detect and treat missing values
* Detect and treat outliers
The ultimate goal of data exploration machine learning is to provide data insights that will inspire subsequent feature engineering and the model-building process. Feature engineering facilitates the machine learning process and increases the predictive power of machine learning algorithms by creating features from raw data.



# Data Exploration in Python
Data exploration with python has the advantage in ease of learning, production readiness, integration with common tools, an abundant library, and support from a huge community. Nearly every tool kit and functionality is packaged and can be executed by simply calling the name of a method.

Python data exploration is made easier with Pandas, the open source Python data analysis library that can single-handedly profile any dataframe and generate a complete HTML report on the dataset. Once Pandas is imported, it allows users to import files in a variety of formats, the most popular format being CSV. The pandas data exploration library provides:

* Efficient dataframe object for data manipulation with integrated indexing
* Tools for reading and writing data between disparate formats
* Integrated handling of missing data and intelligent data alignment 
* Flexible pivoting and reshaping of datasets
* Time series-functionality
* Intelligent label-based slicing, fancy indexing, and subsetting of large datasets
* Columns can be inserted and deleted from data structures for size mutability
* Aggregating or transforming data with a powerful group by engine allowing split-apply-combine operations on datasets
* High performance merging and joining of datasets
* Hierarchical axis indexing

Techniques for how to improve data exploration using Pandas are discussed at length in expansive Python community forums.


# What is the Relationship Between Data Exploration and Data Mining?
There are two primary methods for retrieving relevant data from large, unorganized pools: data exploration, which is the manual method, and data mining, which is the automatic method. Data mining, a field of study within machine learning, refers to the process of extracting patterns from data with the application of algorithms. Data exploration and visualization provide guidance in applying the most effective further statistical and data mining treatment to the data.

Once the relationships between the different variables have been revealed, analysts can proceed with the data mining process by building and deploying data models equipped with the new insights gained. Data exploration and data mining are sometimes used interchangeably.



# Data Discovery vs Data Exploration
Once data exploration has refined the data, data discovery can begin. Data discovery is the business-user-oriented process for exploring data and answering highly specific business questions. This iterative process seeks out patterns and looks at clusters, sequences of events, specific trends, and time-series analysis, and plays an integral part in business intelligence systems, providing visual navigation of data and facilitating the consolidation of all business information.

Most popular data discovery tools provide data exploration and preparation and modeling capabilities, support visual and digestible data representations, allow interactive navigation and sharing options, support access to data sources, and offer seamless integration of data preparation, analysis, and analytics. Learn how OmniSci's converged analytics platform integrates these capabilities to derive insights from your largest datasets at the speed of curiosity.
